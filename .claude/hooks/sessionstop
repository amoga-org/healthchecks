## Changelog Guidelines

When completing coding tasks or making significant changes:

1. Create detailed summary in .github/changelog/ with format: yyyy-mm-dd-hhmm-brief-description.md

   Required Content:
   - Changes Made (files created/modified/deleted)
   - Implementation approach and details
   - Key decisions and architectural choices
   - Testing notes and validation
   - Related documentation updates

2. Update .github/changelog/CHANGELOG.md by adding entry at top:
   - Date and descriptive title
   - One paragraph summary of changes
   - Reference to detailed summary file
   - Keep reverse chronological order (latest first)

This maintains both detailed work logs and a high-level changelog for quick reference.
